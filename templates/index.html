            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p>This web application provides real-time sentiment analysis of the 50 most recent posts from r/politics, and will update based on new posts. </p>
            <p>It uses a Flask backend with TextBlob for sentiment processing, and HTML/CSS/JS on the front-end.</p>
            <h2>Current Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Displays mean and median sentiment statistics based on the analyzed post titles.</li>
                <li>Shows the title and sentiment score of the 50 analyzed posts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Work in Progress</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancing the "Real-time" feature to update sentiment analysis every 6 seconds, pending increased subreddit activity.</li>
                <li>Considering implementation of other subreddits such as r/popular for broader sentiment analysis.</li>
                <li>Expanding the application to include sentiment analysis for additional subreddits, starting with r/AITA.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improving sentiment analysis accuracy by exploring more advanced classifiers beyond TextBlob, potentially including the training of custom machine learning models.</li>
            </ul>
